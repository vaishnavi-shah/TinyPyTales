# TinyPyTales
TinyPyTales is my personal collection of small Python scripts, documenting my journey as I learn and practice the basics of Python. Each folder contains simple exercises and projects to help reinforce my understanding.
Here "PS" refers to "Practice Set" , questions that i practiced based on the chapter's concept.
